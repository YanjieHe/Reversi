# Reversi
Reversi is a board game. It is much more complicated than the Tic Tac Toe. Due to the vast amount of possible state of the game, it is next to impossible to enumerate every situation. Therefore, I implemented the minimax with alpha-beta pruning. The difficulty is how to evaluate current game state. I choose a simple solution: to evaluate the game by the position of the chess pieces. There exist a lot of better solutions, and I am eager to learn more about artificial intelligence in the future. And hopefully, I will be able to enhance the performance of the A.I. of the Reversi by implementing better algorithms.

The UI of my reversi program is in the following figure.
